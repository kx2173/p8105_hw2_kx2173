## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet.

```{r trash_wheel}
trash_wheel = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                         range = "A2:N535")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  drop_na(dumpster)%>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019.

```{r combined_precipitation}
precipitation_2018 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "2018 Precipitation", 
                         range = "A2:B14")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(year = c("2018","2018","2018","2018","2018","2018","2018","2018","2018","2018","2018","2018"))



precipitation_2019 = read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "2019 Precipitation", 
                         range = "A2:B14")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(year = c("2019","2019","2019","2019","2019","2019","2019","2019","2019","2019","2019","2019"))

combined_precipitation = 
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019)%>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])

class(pull(combined_precipitation, month)) # To check if "month" variable is a character variable.
```

Write a paragraph about data:

In Trash Wheel data, it has key variables: `r names(trash_wheel)`, and has `r nrow(trash_wheel)` observations.
In precipitation data for 2018 and 2019, it has variables: `r names(combined_precipitation)`, and total number of observation is `r nrow(combined_precipitation)`.
The total precipitation in 2018 is `r sum(pull(precipitation_2018, total))`.
The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is `r median(pull(filter(trash_wheel, year == 2019), sports_balls))`.
